# code-quiz
A timed and scored quiz on the computer programming terms I have learned thus far. 

The page uses an alert to freeze the logic until the user is ready, and then starts a timer and fills a question to the page. Once a user selects an answer and clicks the submit button, it evaluates whether the answer is correct. If false, it removes 5 seconds from the timer. If true, it adds 5 points to the score. When time is up, or all questions have been answered, it takes the user to a page with all the high-scores.
